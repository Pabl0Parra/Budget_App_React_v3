## :wrench: **Tech used in this project**

In this project I´m using React JS to develop a tutorial in which, with two buttons, new users can move forward and backward through the tips, modifying the help text and background image every time either button is clicked.
I will also implement a welcome screen with a button to begin the tutorial.
Since I don´t yet have the proper documentation or an API, I will hardcore some example data to reproduce the desire output.

## :mortar_board: **What did I learn from this project**

Through this project I have been able to learn the basics of React, create and implement my first reusable components, make use of props, how to work with styled-components, learn how to implement useState & how to use conditional rendering to display different screens.

---

## :memo: **What do I still need to do**

~~1. Concentrate all styles under one js file through style-components~~

~~2. Get rid of unnecesary files & images~~

3. Make sure welcome screen renders by itself.
